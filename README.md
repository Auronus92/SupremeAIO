DOCUMENTATION LINK

After installation you want to load the bot up and add your billing information under File > Profile Editor.

Then you can set up a task on left panel of the main bot. Keywords should be whole separated with spaces, no commas or other symbols. Keywords can be found here

Select the desired category the item will be in, do not use the new category, size and colour. Use the Browser mode for now as the Requests still needs finishing.

Input localhost in the proxy field, edit the number of tasks if you wish to do so, use the Default Profile and click create Task.

Supreme drops at 11:00:00 GTM On Thursday so you want to start tasks at this 5-10 seconds before, Browser instances will launch which are visible and will attempt to automate the checkout process.

Disclaimer: Please keep in my mind this bot is still in beta and there might be bugs here and there in this case raise a issue and i will try fixing them. Also if anyone wants to help with development as this is a community project feel free to create a pull request.
